# Indian_Startups_Ecosystem_2
We embark on a journey of discovery as we leverage our data analysis expertise to uncover the untapped potential within the Indian startup ecosystem. This project is designed to not only decode the numbers but to distill insights that will guide our team towards a successful foray into this dynamic market.We will explore the world of the startup ecosystem in India from 2018 to 2021. India has experienced a surge in startups and funding, with over 16,000 new tech companies added in 2020. Despite funding obstacles, investment firms have shown confidence in Indian startups, with a total budget of $ 8.4 billion in 2023. The project aims to investigate the funding trends in the Indian startup ecosystem and propose the best course of action for venturing into this dynamic market. We will conduct the project using Python programming language following the CRISP-DM methodology to analyze data and draw meaningful insights.
